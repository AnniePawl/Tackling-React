# DOM (Document Object Model)
DOM stands for: Document Object Model 
- We can render JSX directly to HTML DOM using React's rendering API known as **ReactDOM**
- ReactDOM offers simple method to render Reat elements: 
`ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode)`. 
  - First argument is component you want to render 
  - Second argument is DOM node that you want to render component to. 
  - ReactDOM.render() must be called after JSX element declarations (just like declaring car before using it )

  ### `document.getElementById()`
  Use document.getElementById to seelct DOM node to render them to. 
  `ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode)`

# What is React?
Simply put, React is a JavaScript Library for building user interfaces. Open source view library created and maintained by Facebook. 
- Uses syntax extension of JavaScript valled JSX 

## Why is it great?
**Declarative:** Simple views for each state that efficiently update and render when data changes <br>
**Component Based:** Encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs <br>
Components are written in JavaScript instead of templates, making it easy to pass a lot of data though app, while still keeping the state out of the DOM <br>
**Versatile:** React can be rendered on server using *Node* ad it can power mobile apps using *ReactNative*
